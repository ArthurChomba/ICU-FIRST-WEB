1. Which HTML element did you find most challenging to implement and why?
The <table> element was the most challenging. While straightforward for simple data, creating an accessible, semantically correct table with proper <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, and scoped <th> tags required careful attention. Ensuring it was responsive and readable on mobile devices without CSS was also difficult.

3. How did you use semantic elements to structure your content?
· <header>: Used for the site title and main introduction.
· <nav>: Contained the navigation menu with links to sections (About, Projects, Contact).
· <main>: Wrapped the primary content of each page.
· <section>: Divided content into distinct parts (e.g., "My Projects," "Skills").
· <article>: Used for individual blog posts or project descriptions.
· <footer>: Held copyright info and social media links.
